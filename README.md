External API
This currency converter uses the ExchangeRate-API to fetch the latest exchange rates. You can sign up for a free account to get an API key.

In the currency converter project, I utilize the getElementById and getElementsByClassName methods to access specific elements within the HTML document and manipulate them using JavaScript. These methods are fundamental to interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model) and dynamically updating the content of the webpage based on user actions or external data.

I use getElementById to retrieve specific elements such as the amount input field, currency dropdowns, and result display area.
I use getElementsByClassName to retrieve a collection of elements with the class name input-container, which allows me to perform operations on all elements with that class.
By using these methods, I can effectively target and manipulate elements within the HTML document, facilitating the functionality of the currency converter application.
